You must update the version number in `package.json` and `public/production.json` after every single prompt where you make code changes.
Increment the patch version (e.g., 3.0.7 -> 3.0.8) for small changes, minor version (e.g., 3.0.0 -> 3.1.0) for new features, and major version (e.g., 3.0.0 -> 4.0.0) for breaking changes.
Track our production time. Use our track-time.js script to do this.
start the script always when antigravity start working on this project.
stop the script always when antigravity stop working on this project.
always reload the page when you make changes to the code.
Deploy to GitHub Pages every 5 prompts with a minor version bump (e.g., 3.2.0 -> 3.3.0). Run: git add ., git commit -m "Deploy v{version}", git push, npm run deploy.
For new projects, configure Git with: git config --global user.email "radim.petruska@gmail.com" and git config --global user.name "krtekx".
